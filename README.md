## Who am I?
I am a student who has interests in many feilds of subject, my main interests at the current momnent would be technology, and automotive mechanics.
In the past I have had many other interests, all of which are still generally around technology, some of these were game development, gameserver development, desktop applicatoin development, web development. and linux.

## How it all started
I've always hada cuirosity on how things worked, just the general mechanics of how things would operate. That would later transfer to computers when I got heavily investing in gaming when I was young. Since I had access to a computer I was able to play a lot of desktop games which had modding capibility. From modding games I learnt how games are actually made and and all the things around it. From that I started using different engines to make (very poor) games, all of which I got bored on and eventually forgot about and lost.

From 2019-2021 I got heavily into the game Garry's Mod which is a community server driven game. In that game making addons is common which i did have an interest in, but what I had a higher interest in was making a server for it. and from 2020-2021 I would co-own and develop a server with a couple of online friends. From that I learnt a lot about web development because that was what I did most becuase it wasn't something that was always in immideate need of changing. I did also develop on the server, but with my little knownlage of lua it wasn't something I could do much other than add files and edit the configs. 
The server actually was semi sucsessful gaining a community of around 100 players with 15-30 of them being active during our peak. and from that community one of the other owners was able to create his current Dayz community which has 800 members with 20-30 active players which is pretty cool.

## What am I doing now?
I havent been doing much recently, more just doing life stuff. lately the only coding/development (if you could call it development) would be my linux build or some random niche project that I use once and probably never again.
